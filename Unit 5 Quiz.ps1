#Ask a user to input a number and using if statements tell the user if it is higher or lower then a number you pick out.



#Using Get-Process get only the StartTime property and store it in a variable

#Using a loop print each line of the variable you stored the start times in, and have it print the start time each time the loop runs and a message telling the user what it is outputting.
